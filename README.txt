A time server
Return to: 16 April - 22 A...
Create a simple server (single client) that can return the time and date whenever a client connects to it..

for example, it could work like this:

$ telnet 127.0.0.1  5555

connected...

It's  Apr 16 2021, Time is:  14:50:00

...disconnected..

$


That is, the server responds with date and time.. and disconnects.. See if you can create a such server.. please provide your C source code for the server and a screenshot..
